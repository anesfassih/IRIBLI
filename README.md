# IRIBLI
Arabic Sentence Analyzer, with Automaton Principle in a context of continuous improvement.

This work is done for a final year project in Natural Language Processing. It is done in order to facilitate the learning of grammatical analysis (الإعراب) of Arabic texts for young students.
The solution is an implementation of the following :
- A morphological analysis that allows to detect the possibilities of
grammatical categories of a word based on its pattern and voyellation,
or on resources if it is not an inflectional word.
- A grammatical analysis which is based on grammatical rules indicating the arrangement of the entities of a sentence and which the program will learn  with the intervention of Arabic teachers.
